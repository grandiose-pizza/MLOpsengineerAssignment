# Senior MLOps Engineer Assignment

## Overview
This assignment is designed to test your skills in MLOps, including CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, Kubernetes orchestration, machine learning model deployment, monitoring, logging, and cloud services. You will be given a mix of theoretical questions and practical tasks to complete within 24 hours using open-source tools.

## Theoretical Component
Please answer the following questions:
1. What are the key considerations when setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a machine learning project?
2. How does containerization benefit machine learning deployment?
3. Describe a scenario where Kubernetes can be used to manage the lifecycle of a machine learning application.
4. What are some open-source tools for monitoring and logging in a machine learning context?

## Practical Component
For the practical component, you will be provided with a simple machine learning model. Your tasks are to:
- Containerize the model using Docker.
- Deploy the containerized model to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline that automates the testing and deployment of the model.
- Implement basic monitoring and logging for the deployed model.

## Local Kubernetes Cluster Setup
To complete the practical tasks, you will need a local Kubernetes cluster. You can set this up using either minikube or kind, which are tools that allow you to run Kubernetes clusters locally on your machine.

### Minikube
Minikube creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop. To install and start minikube, follow these steps:
1. Download and install minikube from the [official website](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
2. Start a minikube cluster by running `minikube start`.
3. Verify the cluster is running with `minikube status`.

### Kind
Kind runs Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers. It's particularly useful if you want to create multi-node clusters. To use kind, follow these steps:
1. Install Docker if you haven't already.
2. Download and install kind from the [official website](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
3. Create a new cluster with `kind create cluster`.
4. Verify the nodes are running with `kubectl get nodes`.

Please ensure you have either minikube or kind set up before proceeding with the practical tasks.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Correctness of theoretical answers.
- Code quality and best practices in the practical tasks.
- Documentation and explanation of your approach.

Good luck!
