# Senior MLOps Engineer Assignment

## Overview
This assignment is designed to test your skills in MLOps, including CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, Kubernetes orchestration, machine learning model deployment, monitoring, logging, and cloud services. You will be given a mix of theoretical questions and practical tasks to complete within 24 hours using open-source tools.

## Theoretical Component
Please answer the following questions:
1. What are the key considerations when setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a machine learning project?
2. How does containerization benefit machine learning deployment?
3. Describe a scenario where Kubernetes can be used to manage the lifecycle of a machine learning application.
4. What are some open-source tools for monitoring and logging in a machine learning context?

## Practical Component
For the practical component, you will be provided with a simple machine learning model. Your tasks are to:
- Containerize the model using Docker.
- Deploy the containerized model to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline that automates the testing and deployment of the model.
- Implement basic monitoring and logging for the deployed model.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Correctness of theoretical answers.
- Code quality and best practices in the practical tasks.
- Documentation and explanation of your approach.

Good luck!
